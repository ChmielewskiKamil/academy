# Welcome to RedStone Academy

### üßë‚Äçüéì Our mission

**RedStone Academy** was created from the need for having reliable source of knowledge about smart contracts on Arweave. We would like to provide a set of materials which will give a basic and more advanced understanding of what Arweave blockchain and smart contracts are. We believe that it is best to learn by example, so the course will be divided into modules which end with a small project created with the use of proposed tools.

**RedStone Academy** is designed for everyone no matter their background. Our mission is to encourage more people to start learning and building on Arweave. The course is constantly updated and we will be adding new materials regularly.

If you will ever feel that something is missing in the chapter or you will find the informations incorrect please contact us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46) or edit page using dedicated **Edit this page** feature at the bottom of each section.
