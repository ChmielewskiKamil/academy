# Preparations

Now we have basic understanding of what PSTs are, we can dive into code.
We prepared for you some basic setup consiting of Vue2 and Bootstrap for the frontend part, Typescript, Jest and ts-jest for tests, ts-node for running scripts. You can of course use other tools/frameworks. However, we recommend using the ones we prepared while going through this tutorial. You will need to write some code during the tutorial so the application can work. I advise you to read the instructions first and then trying on your own. You can always view final solution in [redstone-academy-pst/final](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-academy/tree/main/redstone-academy-pst/final).

Let the fun begin!

## ⛏️ Install dependencies

Firstly install all dependencies by running:

Then, install all dependencies connected with SmartWeave contracts. And do not worry, you will learn, how to use them pretty soon. Run following command:

```bash

You're good to go!
