We prepare for you some basic setup consiting of Vue2 and, Bootstrap for frontend part, Typescript, Jest and ts-jest for tests, ts-node for running scripts. You can of course use other tools/frameworks. However, we recommend using the ones we prepared. You will need to write some code during the tutorial so the application can work.
