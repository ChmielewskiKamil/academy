# Profit Sharing Communities

## ❓ What are PSCs?

Profit Sharing Community (PSC) are decentralised, open-sourced companies built on the Permaweb using SmartWeave contracts. Depending on how many of the community's PSTs a person holds and for how long a person wants to hold these tokens, the voting power is determined. It means that even small token holders can have power analogous to 'bigger fishes' (if they are for example willing to hold tokens for a long time).

## ✅ Benefits of PSCs

Profit Sharing Communities provide more control for founders of the projects and at the same time assures contributors with more power. Thanks to PSCs contributors have fair governance rights, instant liquidity and of course revenue distributed to all the holder from the application usage
