# What is blockchain?

### Definition

Blockchain is defined as a decentralized, distributed and immutable ledger storing data - you can think about it as of a big digital database. It maintains list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. This digital ledger is distributed and duplicated across the entire network of computer systems (nodes) on the blockchain.

Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions and when new transaction is supposed to be added, nodes communicate (sticking to a protocol) and validate new blocks. A record of that transaction is then added to every participant's ledger.

### Proof of Work

In order to confirm transactions we need some sort of consensus mechanism. The first one was called Proof of Work (PoW). It is executed by miners - key participants of the blockchain. They must show proof of work (and show it fastest) to win the right to mine a block (in simple words - add block to the chain). The **work** means solving complex math ptoblems and the **proof** is the solution to the problem. Virtual miners around the world participate in this contest to solve a math puzzle first, update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions and get rewarded with specific amount of cryptocurrency.

### Immutability

An immutable cryptographic signature called a hash is added to each block, so if one block in one chain was changed all the nodes would have immediately known about it. So in order to manipulate blockchain's data in mailicious way, a hacker would need to change every block in the chain across all duplicated versions of chain.

### Cryptocurrency

Blockchain enables existence of cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a digital form of exchange which uses encryption techniques for its creation and verification of the transfer of funds.
Cryptocurrencies are denominated into crypto tokens whic represent fungible and tradable assets which are part of blockchain.

### Wallet

A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, manage, and trade their cryptocurrencies.
