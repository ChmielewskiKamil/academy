# Implementation tutorial for Ardit contract on SmartWeave

This tutorial shows how to implement a simple contract which can be a base for a social application.

## üí° The smart contract idea

The idea of this tutorial is to build a smart contract which can be then used in decentralized social application. The contract will be as simple as possible providing us with an option to post a message, upvote or downvote a message and read a message based on its id.

## üöÄ Deployed version

_TODO: Update addresses_

We've already deployed the contract source on the Arweave blockchain. Its transaction id is [xOnWzXwuZ8PYbrjOBpz-kEAV0l0_soyvrxAS35weysU](https://sonar.warp.cc/#/app/source/xOnWzXwuZ8PYbrjOBpz-kEAV0l0_soyvrxAS35weysU). You can check its source code in our [SonAR.](https://sonar.warp.cc/#/app/source/xOnWzXwuZ8PYbrjOBpz-kEAV0l0_soyvrxAS35weysU#code).

The final implementation is available in the [github repo](https://github.com/warp-contracts/academy/tree/main/warp-academy-ardit/final).
