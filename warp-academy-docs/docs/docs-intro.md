### üßë‚Äçüéì Our mission

The aim of this section is to give basic and advanced understanding of the features specific for Warp SDK. We will cover them one by one to provide building blocks from which it will be possible to develop even most advanced smart contracts on Arweave.

If you want to expand your knowledge or explore interfaces for the features we will explain in the academy, check out [Warp SDK repository](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp).

Warp team is always willing to help, so if you will have any ideas for new chapters or you will find the informations incorrect please contact us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46) or edit page using dedicated **Edit this page** feature at the bottom of each section.
